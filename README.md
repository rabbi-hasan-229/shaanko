## 🌉 About The Project

**Shaanko** (meaning "Bridge") is a platform designed to connect buyers and sellers of digital goods in Bangladesh through a verified, secure, and AI-monitored ecosystem.

The digital goods market in Bangladesh is currently the "Wild West"—trades happen in informal groups leading to constant scams and zero accountability. **Shaanko builds the infrastructure for trust.** We act as the escrow and validator to ensure every transaction is secure.

## 🚀 Key Features

* **🛡️ Mandatory e-KYC:** Sellers must be verified via NID/Phone to list items.
* **🔒 Secure Escrow System:** Payments are held securely until delivery is confirmed.
* **🤖 AI-Driven Security:** Automated fraud pattern detection to flag suspicious behavior.
* **✅ Delivery Confirmation:** Logic-based confirmation to protect both parties.
* **📱 Mobile First:** Optimized for Gamers, Content Creators, and Freelancers.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

This repository contains the **Landing Page** for the Shaanko ecosystem. The broader platform is built using:

* **Landing Page:** HTML5, CSS3 (Glassmorphism UI)
* **Mobile App (MVP):** Flutter
* **Backend:** Supabase
* **Identity:** OTP Authentication & NID Verification
* **Payments:** Manual Verification (Bkash/Nagad) with future SSLCOMMERZ integration.
